'clawboo': patch
---

fix(cli): HTTP-verify Clawboo identity during port discovery, don't TCP-probe blindly.
The OpenClaw Gateway listens on auxiliary ports (18791, 18792) in addition to its main 18789. Those fall inside Clawboo's 18790-18809 fallback window. v0.1.2's `findRunningDashboard()` did a TCP-only probe, so when 18790 was free but 18791 was held by Gateway (or by Chrome's --remote-debugging-port, or any other listener), the CLI mistook the unrelated port for Clawboo's already-running dashboard, skipped spawning the bundled server, and opened the browser to that port's 401 page (rendered as "Unauthorized" plain text).
Fix: new `probeClawbooDashboard()` does a TCP probe AND a Clawboo-shaped JSON check on `/api/settings`. Only ports that return a real Clawboo response are accepted.
Also adds `scripts/test-clean-install.mjs` — a full clean-install simulation that boots a fake non-Clawboo listener on 18791 before invoking the CLI, guaranteeing this exact regression class can't ship again. Wired into both `ci.yml` (PR gate) and `publish.yml` (last-line defense before npm publish).

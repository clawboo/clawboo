## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- be71923: First real release. Replaces the v0.0.0 / v0.1.0 placeholder builds.

  Ships the v0.1.0 marketplace-redesign milestone:
  - 304 first-class agent catalog entries across 3 sources (agency-agents, awesome-openclaw, clawboo builtin)
  - 82 workflow team templates (5 builtin, 5 agency-workflows, 42 awesome-openclaw, 30 synthetic excellence partitions)
  - 3-tab marketplace (Skills / Agents / Teams) with single-agent deploy flow
  - Atlas global org-graph + Group Chat team halos with Boo Zero as universal leader
  - Multi-agent orchestration: structured `<delegate>` protocol, multi-step `<plan>` state machine, parallel workstreams with auto-synthesis, relay-batching, override-fix retry
  - DelegationCards / PlanCards / WorkstreamCards with tint-aware borders, accordion topology, completion flash
  - Auto-install onboarding (Detect → Install → Configure → StartGateway → Team → Deploy)
  - Dynamic API port resolution (default 18790, auto-fallback through 18809) — never collides with other dev servers
  - Hybrid agent knowledge delivery (AGENTS.md essentials + CLAWBOO.md reference + self-documenting `[Team Update]` envelopes)
  - Local-DB ghost cleanup + per-agent KV cleanup on agent delete
  - 857 unit tests, 12 e2e tests, full CI gating via `pnpm verify:ingest` on marketplace codegen
